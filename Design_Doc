Group Assignment 2
Design Justification



easy extensibility to other forms of payment, including mixed modes (e.g., paying partially with coins, partially with credit card):

a new hardware for payment is added, we just have to implement the listener for that hardware and that listener will use the add_credit function. Same goes for choosing the pop cans as well. 



ease of supporting alternative hardware:

We have moved all of our logical functions into modules outside of our vending manager. All the functions necessary to access hardware components are only defined in the vending manager. Also, listeners do not have direct access to the logic functions and must go through vending manager. Therefore in case of any change in hardware majority of our code, including the logical functions, do not need to change.



ease of changing details on communication with the user and to the event log:

Messaging:

We have a display class which is in charge of handling user messages. Either it can be used in a cyclical queue mode, which can display several messages sequentially with different durations on repeat and can be interrupted at any states. Or display a single messages when needed. 

Logging:

Our log class works in a singleton pattern and it is stationed in our VendingManger class. 
If any class or method add_log method of vending manager can be called  and it automatically date and time stamp the logs and you can set expiration dates.
